Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet
when BTC came there was not concept of this 
throught BTC improvement proposal (BIP) it was introduced
BIP 32 - HD Wallets
BIP 39 - Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys
BIP 44 - Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets

BIP 32 
problem before HD wallet
it was very hard to create and transcat in crypto 
every time you had to create new address and store the private key somewhere safe
if you lost the private key you lost the coins forever  

wallets -- phantom, backpack ,metamask
beacuse of this 2 yr old can hold crypto now
as he holding his private keys in mnemonic phrase


public key pvt key (32 bytes)
RSA
ssh-keygen 

but these pvt keys are not rememebral 

BIP 32
problem:
you have to store multiple pvt keys for multiple addresses
solution:
from single seed you can generate multiple pvt keys and addresses
seed -- 512 bits (64 bytes)



BIP 39 -- mneomic/seed phrase
mnemonic phrase -- human readable form of seed
BIP 39
mnemoic phrase can be used to generate seed
mnemonic phrase is generated from wordlist of 2048 words
12 words -- 128 bits of entropy
15 words -- 160 bits of entropy
18 words -- 192 bits of entropy
21 words -- 224 bits of entropy
24 words -- 256 bits of entropy


pass u put on wallet in for your laptop protecting your wallet from hackers
and frnds of youurs try to open in your laptop 


base58 is solana uses for solana


dipe deep into the backpack code 

m/44/60/0 -- path for ethereum in bip 44
m/44/501/0 -- path for solana in bip 44
m/44/0/0 -- path for bitcoin in bip 44
BIP 44

derivation path
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
purpose -- 44 for bip 44
coin_type -- 0 for BTC , 60 for ETH , 501 for SOL
account -- you can have multiple accounts
change -- 0 for external chain , 1 for internal chain
address_index -- address index

where is the balance of user stored in BTC SOL ETH
utx address 

btc is basically straight line transaction decentrailized
ETH is smart contract based, deccentralized application, rapid time
solana is account based , deccentralized application


what is validator ? 


smart contracts? 
dapp?

eth -- soldiity 
sol -- rust, proof of stake?
